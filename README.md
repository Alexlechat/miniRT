# Chapter I

# Introduction

When it comes to rendering 3-dimensional computer-generated images there are 2 possi-
ble approaches: “Rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because
of its efficiency and “Ray Tracing.”

The “Ray Tracing” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon
since) is even today more expensive in computation than the “Rasterization” method.
As a result, it is not yet fully adapted to real time use-cases but it produce a much higher
degree of visual realism.

```
Figure I.1:The pictures above are rendered with the ray tracing technique. Impressive isn’t it?
```
Before you can even begin to produce such high-quality graphics, you must mas-
ter the basics: theminiRTis your first ray tracer coded inC, normed and humble but
functionnal.

The main goal ofminiRTis to prove to yourself that you can implement any mathe-
matics or physics formulas without being a mathematician, we will only implement the
most basics ray tracing features here so just keep calm, take a deep breath anddon’t
panic! After this project you’ll be able to show off nice-looking pictures to justify the
number of hours you’re spending at school...


# Chapter II

# Common Instructions

- Your project must be written in C.
- Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
    files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
    is a norm error inside.
- Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
    free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
    considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
    will be tolerated.
- If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefilewhich will compile your
    source files to the required output with the flags-Wall,-Wextraand-Werror, use
    cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
- YourMakefilemust at least contain the rules$(NAME),all,clean,fcleanand
    re.
- To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rulebonusto your Makefile,
    which will add all the various headers, libraries or functions that are forbidden on
    the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file_bonus.{c/h}if
    the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation
    is done separately.
- If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
    associatedMakefilein alibftfolder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s
    Makefilemust compile the library by using itsMakefile, then compile the project.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
    **won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded**. It will give you a chance
    to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
    useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
    and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git reposi-
    tory will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done

```
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
```

# Chapter III

# Mandatory part - miniRT

```
Program name miniRT
Turn in files All your files
Makefile all, clean, fclean, re, bonus
Arguments a scene in format *.rt
External functs.
```
- open, close, read, write,
    printf, malloc, free, perror,
    strerror, exit
- All functions of the math
    library. (Man page: man
    math.h or man 3 math. Don’t
    forget to compile with the
    -lm flag.)
- All functions of the MinilibX

```
Libft authorized Yes
Description The goal of your program is to generate
images using the Raytracing protocol. Those
computer-generated images will each represent a
scene, as seen from a specific angle and position,
defined by simple geometric objects, and each with
its own lighting system.
```
```
The constraints are as follows:
```
- Youmustuse theminiLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating
    system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will
    need to apply the same rules for your libftas those written above inCommon
    Instructionspart.
- The management of your window must remain fluid: switching to another window,
    minimization, etc..
- You need at least these 3 simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder.


miniRT My first RayTracer with miniLibX

- If applicable, all possible intersections and the inside of the object must be handled
    correctly.
- Your program must be able to resize the object’s unique properties: diameter for a
    sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
- Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformation to
    objects, lights and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
- Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambiance lighting (objects are
    never completely in the dark). You must implement Ambient and diffuse lighting.
- the program displays the image in a window and respect the following rules:

```
◦ PressingESCmust close the window and quit the program cleanly.
```
```
◦ Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.
```
```
◦ The use ofimagesof theminilibXis strongly recommended.
```
- Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the.rt
    extension.

```
◦ Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
```
```
◦ Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more
space(s).
```
```
◦ Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
```
```
◦ Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in
the scene.
```

miniRT My first RayTracer with miniLibX

```
◦ Each element first’s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two
character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict
order such as:
```
```
◦ Ambient lightning:
A 0.2 255,255,
```
```
∗ identifier: A
∗ ambient lighting ratio in range [0.0,1.0]: 0.
∗ R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 255, 255, 255
```
```
◦ Camera:
C -50.0,0,20 0,0,1 70
```
```
∗ identifier: C
∗ x,y,z coordinates of the view point: -50.0,0,
∗ 3d normalized orientation vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis:
0.0,0.0,1.
∗ FOV : Horizontal field of view in degrees in range [0,180]: 70
```
```
◦ Light:
L -40.0,50.0,0.0 0.6 10,0,
```
```
∗ identifier: L
∗ x,y,z coordinates of the light point: -40.0,50.0,0.
∗ the light brightness ratio in range [0.0,1.0]: 0.
∗ (unused in mandatory part)R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 10, 0, 255
```
```
◦ Sphere :
sp 0.0,0.0,20.6 12.6 10,0,
```
```
∗ identifier: sp
∗ x,y,z coordinates of the sphere center: 0.0,0.0,20.
∗ the sphere diameter: 12.
∗ R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 10, 0, 255
```

```
◦ Plane:
pl 0.0,0.0,-10.0 0.0,1.0,0.0 0,0,
```
```
∗ identifier: pl
∗ x,y,z coordinates of a point in the plane: 0.0,0.0,-10.
∗ 3d normalized normal vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis: 0.0,1.0,0.
∗ R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 0,0,
◦ Cylinder:
cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0.0,0.0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,
```
```
∗ identifier: cy
∗ x,y,z coordinates of the center of the cylinder: 50.0,0.0,20.
∗ 3d normalized vector of axis of cylinder. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis:
0.0,0.0,1.
∗ the cylinder diameter: 14.
∗ the cylinder height: 21.
∗ R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 10, 0, 255
```

miniRT My first RayTracer with miniLibX

- Example of the mandatory part with a minimalist **.rt** scene:

```
A 0.2 255,255,
C -50,0,20 0,0,1 70
L -40,0,30 0.7 255,255,
pl 0,0,0 0,1.0,0 255,0,
sp 0,0,20 20 255,0,
cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0,0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,
```
- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file the program must exit
    properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
- For the defense, it would be ideal for you to have a whole set of scenes with the
    focus on what is functional, to facilitate the control of the elements to create.


# Chapter IV

# Bonus part

TheRay-Tracingtechnique could handle many more things like reflection, transparency,
refraction, more complex objects, soft shadows, caustics, global illumination, bump map-
ping, .obj file rendering etc..

But for theminiRTproject, we want to keep things simple for your first raytracer and
your first steps in CGI.

So here is a list of few simple bonuses you could implement, if you want to do bigger
bonuses we strongly advise you to recode a new ray-tracer later in your developer life
after this little one is finished and fully functionnal.

Figure IV.1: A spot, a space skybox and a shiny earth-textured sphere with bump-maping

```
Bonuses will be evaluated only if your mandatory part is PERFECT.
By PERFECT we naturally mean that it needs to be complete, that it
cannot fail, even in cases of nasty mistakes like wrong uses etc.
It means that if your mandatory part does not obtain ALL the points
during the grading, your bonuses will be entirely IGNORED.
```

miniRT My first RayTracer with miniLibX

```
Bonus list:
```
- Add specular reflection to have a full Phong reflection model.
- Color disruption: checkerboard.
- Colored and multi-spot lights.
- One other 2nd degree object: Cone, Hyperboloid, Paraboloid..
- Handle bump map textures.

```
You are allowed to use other functions and add features to your
scene description to complete the bonus part as long as their use is
justified during your evaluation. You are also allowed to modify the
expected scene file format to fit your needs. Be smart!

# Submission and peer-evaluation

Turn in your assignment in your Gitrepository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the
names of your files to ensure they are correct.
